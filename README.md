# Objective-C Memory Management Bug: Retain Cycles

This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug related to memory management. Specifically, it showcases how improper handling of `nonatomic, strong` properties can lead to retain cycles and unexpected application behavior, such as crashes or memory leaks.

The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version illustrating how to avoid the issue.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs because of a retain cycle created by improperly managed strong references between two objects.  This prevents the objects from being deallocated, resulting in memory leaks and potentially application instability. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing object lifecycles and using techniques like `weak` properties to break retain cycles.
