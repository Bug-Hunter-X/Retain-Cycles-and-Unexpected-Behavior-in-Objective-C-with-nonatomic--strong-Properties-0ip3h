In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `nonatomic, strong` or `nonatomic, retain`.  If you're not careful about how you're setting these properties, especially when objects are being deallocated, you can experience unexpected crashes or unexpected behavior, particularly if you're working with circular references.

For instance:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) AnotherClass *anotherObject;

@end

@implementation MyClass

- (void)setAnotherObject:(AnotherClass *)anotherObject {
    _anotherObject = anotherObject;
}

@end
```

If `anotherObject` also has a strong reference back to `MyClass`, you create a retain cycle. Neither object will ever be deallocated, leading to memory leaks.
